- 👋 Hi, I’m Abhinav, working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Nevada Reno
- 👀 I’m interested in Applied mechanics, Flexible structures, Dynamics, Finite element technique, and Fluid-Solid intereactions
- 🌱 I’m currently modeling and simulating the motion of flexible string using finite difference schemes
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting problems in applied mechanics that involve computational analyses of differential equations 
- 📫 Reach me on my work email adehadrai @ unr . edu
